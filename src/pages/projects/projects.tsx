      "Developed a system to identify microplastics, microfibres, and wood debris in microscope samples. Using transfer learning on a MobileNetV2 convolutional neural network with a small dataset, the model achieved 63.9% mAP, 77% precision, and 65% recall. The project demonstrates the potential of automated detection, but real-world samples contain more impurities, so combining this approach with methods like fluorescence microscopy is recommended for more reliable results.",
